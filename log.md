# 100 Days Of Code - Log
**** Note: Any day that specifies "Day NJ5" refers to a day that was mainly full of research, and not so much coding. Since this challenge is to code for one hour a day, I would feel like I was cheating if I was to use those days as actually part of the challenge, even though there was still plenty of learning happening. Regardless, those days and related notes are still present in this log as a reminder of what all was learned and to show that progress was still being made, rather than there just being gaps in the log. ****










### Day 1: Sept 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Forked the 100 Days of Code repo, and edited it according to what I can understand and have knowledge of.
* Created a new repo and merged it with the 100 days of code challenge repo
* Learned how to format Markdown using git and github tutorial via YT and Mrdium article, and created a proper README.md for the repo.
* Registered with Python for Everybody course from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**
* To be honest, I have no idea how logs, resource and other .md are created in github so I am doing it my way with tria and error

**Links to exercise or portfolio**
